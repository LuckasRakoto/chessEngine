# Creating a chess engine

The initial goal was to create a chessAI from scratch. That would mean I would have to create an entire chess engine. 
I did not want to use python-chess, so I went with pygame. I underestimated how long creating the entire chess engine would
be. I wanted my project to be the AI behind the game and not the chess engine. Thus created another [project](https://github.com/LuckasRakoto/chessAI) 
that uses chessjs and chessbackgroundjs to focus mainly on the AI part more than the chess engine

When I stopped working on this it [looked like this](http://g.recordit.co/UElj0GOktj.gif) and only the pawns could move
