# chessAI
The initial goal was to create a chessAI from scratch. That would mean I would have to create an entire chess engine. 
I did not want to use python-chess, so I went with pygame. I underestimated how long creating the entire chess engine would
be. I learned a lot particularly in OOP. But now it's time for me to move on and go back to the initial goal which was create a chessAI.
I swap to chessjs and chessboardjs for the continuation of the project.

When I stopped working on this it looked like that
